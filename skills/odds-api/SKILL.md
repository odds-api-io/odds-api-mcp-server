# Odds-API.io agent guide

The `odds-api` MCP server wraps the Odds-API.io v3 REST API: odds from 450+ bookmakers across 34 sports. The API key comes from the `ODDS_API_KEY` environment variable only; never ask the user to paste it into the chat and never repeat it.

## Call order

1. **Slugs first.** `get_sports` gives sport slugs, `get_leagues` gives league slugs. Never guess a slug.
2. **Find the event.** `search_events` (team name, `status=live` for in-play), `get_events` (sport + league + date window) or `get_live_events`. Past matches: `search_historical_events` or `get_historical_events`.
3. **Market names.** `get_markets` lists the exact names per sport. Use `ML`, `Spread`, `Totals`; there is no "Match Winner", "Over/Under" or "Asian Handicap".
4. **Bookmakers.** Odds tools only return bookmakers in the key's selection: check `get_selected_bookmakers`. `get_bookmakers` shows each book's `status` (ok, degraded, down) when one is missing.
5. **Prices.** `get_odds` or `get_multi_odds` (up to 10 events, one request) with `bookmakers` **and** `markets`. For "best price" or "fair price" questions use `get_odds_summary`.

## Keep responses small

- Always pass `markets` to `get_odds`, `get_multi_odds` and `get_historical_odds`.
- List tools accept `fields` (keep only some keys per item) and `maxResults`; `get_events` also takes `limit`/`skip`.
- `get_outright_odds` takes `markets` and `maxRunners`: a full golf field is 150+ runners per market.
- Pass `sport` to `get_dropping_odds`; without it player props dominate.

## Which tool for which job

| Job | Tool |
|---|---|
| Best / average / fair price | `get_odds_summary` (Growth plan and above; lower plans get `demo: true` sample data, say so) |
| Line history for one book | `get_odds_movements` (prematch; a 404 lists what does exist) |
| Value bets / arbitrage / steam | `get_value_bets`, `get_arbitrage_bets`, `get_dropping_odds` |
| Closing line value, backtests | `get_closing_lines` (up to 10 leagues, 366 days, 100 events per page) |
| Did my bet win? | `get_settlements`, `grade_bets` (up to 50 at once) |
| Golf outrights | `list_outrights` then `get_outright_odds` / `get_outright_results` (Outrights add-on) |
| Polymarket / Kalshi ids | `get_mappings` |
| Requests left this hour | `get_usage` |

## Plans and errors

- **403**: the plan or add-on does not include the endpoint (outrights, closing lines, settlement, mappings and dropping odds need a paid plan or add-on). Relay the message, which names what to enable, and do not retry.
- **429**: the hourly limit is spent until the reset time in the message. Do not retry before then; `get_usage` shows the limit.
- **400**: fix the arguments (usually a slug or market name).
- **401**: the key was rejected; the user can check it or pick a plan at https://odds-api.io/pricing?ref=mcp.

## Caching

Prematch odds change every few seconds to minutes; catalogue data (sports, leagues, markets, bookmakers) changes rarely. Reuse catalogue answers within a conversation instead of calling again. Each tool call is one API request (multi-event calls count as one).

## Answer format

- Name the bookmaker and when the price was updated (`updatedAt`).
- Odds are decimal strings. Score periods use `p1..pN`, `ft`, `ot`, `ap` (older keys `period1`, `overtime`, `penalties`, `fulltime` stop on 12 November 2026).
- Prices and expected value are market data, not predictions. Present arbitrage as a calculated margin at the quoted prices: prices move and bookmakers can limit or void bets.
